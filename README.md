Advanced Linux Shell Scripting Project
Objective:
The objective of this project is to demonstrate advanced skills in using common Linux commands and shell scripting, with a focus on real-world applications and performance optimization.

Assignment Overview:
In this project, I have developed a series of shell scripts to automate common Linux system administration tasks. 
The project includes analyzing the performance of these scripts, identifying any inefficiencies, and applying optimizations. The assignment also requires a detailed report and a video presentation to showcase understanding and thought process.

Part 1: Script Development
Backup Script:
I have created a script to perform backups of user-specified directories. The script features include compression, 
logging of backup status, and error handling. Additionally, the script reports on the size of backup files and any encountered issues.

System Health Check Script:
Another script was developed to check the health of the system. It includes checks for disk space, memory usage, running services, 
and recent system updates. The script outputs a health report with recommendations for actions.

Part 2: Documentation and Video Presentation
Documentation:
A comprehensive report has been provided, covering the purpose and functionality of each script,
insights from performance analysis, detailed descriptions of optimizations, and their impact.
The report is technical yet understandable to someone with basic Linux knowledge.

Conclusion:
This project showcases a deep understanding of Linux system administration, scripting, and performance optimization techniques. 
The developed scripts provide practical solutions to common tasks, while the documentation and presentation offer insights into the methodology and thought process involved in the project.
